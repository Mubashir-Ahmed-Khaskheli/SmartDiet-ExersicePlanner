# Smart Diet & Exercise Planner

## Project Overview
*Smart Diet & Exercise Planner* is a Java-based console application designed to help users create personalized diet and exercise plans based on their fitness goals, such as *Weight Loss* or *Muscle Gain*.  
It also includes special considerations for diabetic users and provides automatic reminders for meals and workouts.

This project demonstrates the core concepts of *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), including **Inheritance, **Polymorphism, **Encapsulation, **Abstraction, and the use of **Threads* for real-time reminders.
